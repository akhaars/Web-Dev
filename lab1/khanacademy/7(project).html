        <h1>Travel to Iceland</h1>
        <p id="intro">Iceland is a unique “land of fire and ice” with a population smaller than that of a small town (about 380,000), almost all of whom live in the capital, and homes heated by geysers. There are no mosquitoes or fast food here, but there is a parliament dating back to 930, a belief in elves, hot water from the tap with the smell of sulfur, and active volcanoes.</p><br>
        <ul>
        
        <li class ="beauty">Þingvellir National Park: a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its picturesque landscape and historical significance (the world's oldest parliament was founded here). The park is located on the fault line between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates, where you can literally walk between continents.</li><br>

<li class = "second"><br>Kerið Crater: a picturesque volcanic crater lake formed about 6,500 years ago. Hiking trails lead to it, and there is an entrance fee (about 400-600 Icelandic kronur).</li><br>
