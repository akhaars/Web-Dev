        <p>The <em>Rainbow lorakeets</em> is awesome because <strong>Rainbow lorikeets are highly social, vividly coloured parrots native to Australia, known for their specialized brush-tipped tongues used to feed on nectar and pollen from over 5,000 plant species. They are intelligent, loud, monogamous birds that mate for life, often seen in large, noisy flocks. These adaptable creatures can live up to 30 years and are known for their acrobatic, often chaotic, behavior. </strong>.</p>
